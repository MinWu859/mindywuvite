    For the links to work, we'll need a <p> element to wrap around the contents:
<nav class="menuA">
    <p>
        <a href="index.html">Home</a> | <a href="starter.html">Starting HTML Example</a> |
            <a href="resume.html">Resume</a> | <a href="gallery.html">Gallery</a> | Course
        Posts
    </p>

<!--ebb: Site Navigation Menu Code B: You can decide if you want this to be a horizontal or vertical arrangement, and make the bullets disappear using CSS.
